- 👋 Hi, I’m @TashaSulli
- 👀 I’m interested in finding out why you guys have been using your project to "help" me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about your AI to change the faces of my family members. I do understand why this was needed. But I do not understand why y'all have been driving me nuts with all your interference, and the crap with JQD. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for one of you to step forward and lay this all out for me, preferably before I end up in a sphyc ward. I'm not even a coder guys, I just know a lot about tech.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm getting my Sim replaced, again, today, and hopefully taking my accounts back over....yeah, and thanks for that nightmare, so you should be able to contact me in the next couple of days. You have all of those accounts and the number.
- 😄 Pronouns: well....I ain't dead yet...so...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am intrigued by all this, but I am seriously pissed off! 
And knock off all the hacking! I will literally SEND stuff to you, you don't need to violate me, and my Family.
